#### Paste-up Mural
A group project in which I participated. It was proposed "what is your perspective of the city"
Firstly, we brainstormed a buch of ideas and designs on to paper with nankim ink. Then, it was digitalized, printed and cut (if needed) to be glued on the wall with a mixture of water and glue.

#### A Fish Inside a Birdcage
I was firstly proposed to make a black and white collage which focused on composition when I came up with this ideia (inspired by a song with the same name). After it's creation, I decided work more on the idea of a fish inside a bird cage, showing that not only is he trapped, but in the complete wrong enviorement.
It evolved to a (really sketchy) stopmotion, which shows him spinning relentlessly inside the cage, pointlessly.
